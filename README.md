Streamlit Machine Learning Application

This project is a simple machine learning application built using Streamlit. It performs image classification using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model and allows users to upload images, interact with the model through input widgets, and visualize the classification results. The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and is easy to use.

Features

- Image Classification: Users can upload an image, and the app will classify it using the MobileNetV2 model.
- Media Display: Uploaded images are displayed within the app.
- Interactive Widgets: Users can adjust the confidence threshold and other settings using sliders and buttons.
- Progress and Status Updates: The app provides feedback while the model processes the input.
- Graphs: A bar chart is used to display the prediction probabilities.
- Sidebar: Input widgets and settings are organized in the sidebar for better user experience.

How to Use

1. Upload an Image: Click on the "Choose an image..." button to upload an image.
2. View Predictions: The app will classify the image using the MobileNetV2 model and display the top 3 predictions.
3. Adjust Settings: Use the sidebar to adjust the confidence threshold.
4. Visualize Results: A bar chart will show the confidence scores for each prediction.
